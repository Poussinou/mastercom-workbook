Features:
- Add support for not-classified marks (such as "A", or Absent). These marks have no numerical value and are thus completely ignored when calculating averages.

Bugs fixed
- Fix when a mark fails to load all of the subject fails
- Fix various crashes caused by subject having only not-classified marks
